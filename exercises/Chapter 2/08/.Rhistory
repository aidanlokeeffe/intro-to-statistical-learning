# b) Look at the data using the fix() function. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each

rownames(college) = college[,1]
fix(college)

# i. Use the summary function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.

# Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using A[,1:10]
