# intro-to-statistical-learning
This repository has been created to contain my work in the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". 

I realized that working through this book would be of enormous help to me in my quest to become a data scientist, as it is widely used to teach the foundations of statistical modeling. It, unfortunately, does not cover neural networks, but in a way, that is a good thing. The Romans were slow and calculated in their conquest of just Italy; in the same vein, I will be better served learning neural networks if I have passed the rite of passage that is learning this content.

Additionally, in my repository bran-survival-analysis, I will be doing statistical modeling in a very complex application, and I want the advanced models provided by this book to be in my toolkit when I finally have the time to grapple with that problem.
